                            </h3>
                            General montereybayarearoundup.org ('SITE or MBAR ') acts as a marketplace, an intermediary between buyers and ticket sellers ('TICKET SELLERS') to facilitate the purchase and sale of event tickets, and as such is not directly involved in the actual ticket sale transaction between the buyers and TICKET SELLERS. ALL SALES ARE FINAL. As tickets sold through SITE are often obtained through the secondary market and prices are determined by the individual ticket seller, the prices for tickets may be above or below face value. Tickets sold through SITE are from a third party; therefore, the buyer's name will not be printed on the tickets. Please note that the name on the tickets does not affect the buyer's ability to access the event. By using or visiting this SITE or purchasing tickets in any manner from the SITE, USER expressly agree to abide and be bound by these Terms and Policies, as well as all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations.
                            <br>
                            ALL SALES ARE FINAL; there are no cancellations, returns, or exchanges.
                            <br>
                            IF AN EVENT IS CANCELLED, USER will be given a full refund minus any delivery charges if the tickets have already been delivered.
                            <br>
                            IF AN EVENT IS POSTPONED OR RESCHEDULED and the original tickets are valid for entry at the time of the rescheduled event, USER order will not qualify for a refund.
                            <br>
                            Confirmed orders may be filled with comparable or upgraded tickets if the original tickets are no longer available.
                            <br>
                            All orders placed the SITE or with the customer contact center must be confirmed by the respective seller before the buyer guarantee takes effect.
                            <br>
                            Our buyer guarantee provides for a full refund in the unlikely event that USER do not receive valid tickets in time to attend the event.
                            <br>
                            The following are the rules ('TERMS') that govern use of the SITE by any user of the SITE ('USER'). By using or visiting the SITE, USER expressly agrees to be bound by these TERMS and to follow these TERMS and all applicable laws and regulations governing the SITE. SITE reserves the right to change these TERMS at any time, effective immediately upon posting on the SITE. If USER violates these TERMS SITE may terminate USER'S access to the SITE, bar USER from future use of the SITE, cancel USER'S ticket order, and/or take appropriate legal action against USER.
                            <br>
                            All sales are final SINCE tickets are a one-of-a-kind item and not replaceable, there are no refunds, exchanges or cancellations. If an event is postponed or rescheduled, tickets will be honored for the rescheduled date. New tickets generally will not need to be issued; in the rare case that new tickets are needed, USER will be contacted by MBAR.
                            <br>
                            If an event is cancelled without a rescheduled date, USER will need to contact the TICKET SELLER who fulfills USER's order (hereinafter known as 'FULFILLER') for a refund. The FULFILLER may require USER to return the supplied tickets at USER's expense before receiving any refund USER is entitled to due to cancellation. SITE is not responsible for providing or securing this refund for USER. Any shipping and handling charges are not refundable. Refunds will be processed in the same currency as the original order. Conversion charges, including though not exhaustive of the ones issued by USER's bank, if any, are not covered by SITE or Fulfiller. Neither SITE nor the FULFILLER will issue exchanges or refunds after a purchase has been made or for lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed tickets. When USER receives tickets, USER should keep them in a safe place. Please note that direct sunlight or heat may damage tickets.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>TICKET AVAILABILITY.</strong>
                            <br>
                            SITE cannot and does not guarantee ticket availability until USER is in possession of their tickets. Generally, all ticket listings on SITE are a unique set of tickets from an individual TICKET SELLER. Some listings on SITE may only be representations of available tickets or an offer by SITE to obtain tickets and not actual seat locations or currently available tickets.
                            <br>
                            Occasionally tickets ordered may no longer be available at the price or in the quantity originally ordered at the time the order is received. If equivalent or better seat locations are available at the same price, the TICKET SELLER will fill the order with the alternative seat locations. If no alternates are available, either USER'S credit card will not be charged at all or the entire amount will be refunded, and USER will be notified that the USER's request has been rejected.
                            <br>
                            Orders placed through SITE will be fulfilled by one of SITE'S network of participating TICKET SELLERS. Contact information for the FULFILLER will be provided to USER upon completion of the purchase process. If this information is lost, USER may <a href="contact.php" class="bb-link">CONTACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT</a>
                            to retrieve information about the order. USER should carefully enter all required information when submitting an order. USER is responsible for any errors made when entering their information, errors may result in issues such as a delay in processing the order or in delivery of tickets or in cancellation of order.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>PRICING.</strong>
                            <br>
                            All prices are in United States Dollars (USD) unless otherwise specifically stated. SITE cannot confirm the price for any products or services purchased on the SITE until after an order is completed by USER. Despite SITE'S best efforts, a small number of products and services listed on the SITE may be priced incorrectly. If the FULFILLER discovers the actual correct price is higher than the stated price, the FULFILLER will either complete the order at the original stated price, contact USER to inform them of different price with an option to purchase, or cancel USER'S order and notify USER of such cancellation.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>SCHEDULE OF FEES AND CHARGES.</strong>
                            <br>
                            The price charged to USER's credit card beyond the price of the individual tickets shall include the following fees and charges:
                            <br>
                            Service Fee: Cost per ticket associated with SITE operation, customer service center operation, obtaining tickets on behalf of USER and other costs associated with the fulfillment of USER's ticket request.

                            USER acknowledges that SITE is a venue allowing people to buy and sell tickets to events. The listings of ticket inventory on SITE are provided by a third party ('PROVIDER'). Neither SITE nor PROVIDER is involved in the actual transaction between buyers and sellers. While SITE and PROVIDER may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, neither SITE nor PROVIDER has control over the content of the tickets listed on SITE, the truth or accuracy of such listings, the ability of the FULFILLER to sell tickets, or that USER and FULFILLER will actually complete a transaction. Regardless of this provision, if either SITE or PROVIDER is found to be liable, SITE or PROVIDER'S liability to USER or any third party is limited to the greater of (a) any amounts due under SITE's limited guarantee when applicable, (b) the amount of fees in dispute not to exceed the total fees of the transaction, or (c) $100.

USER further agrees that the maximum available remedy on any successful claim is the greater of the choices listed in the paragraph above.

                            USER agrees to indemnify and hold SITE, its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents and other partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of USER'S use of the SITE, including also USER'S use of the SITE to provide a link to another site or to upload content or other information to the SITE.

                            USER agrees that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the use of SITE will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

                            <br>
                            Any controversy, claim, dispute, or other action, arising out of or relating to the use of SITE, any order placed on SITE, or these policies including any dispute over the validity, enforceability or scope of this arbitration provision (a 'CLAIM' or 'CLAIMS') shall be resolved through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the 'AAA') in accordance with its Consumer Rules. SITE will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration for a CLAIM of US$1,000 or less. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the CLAIM or the relief sought in the CLAIM is frivolous or that the CLAIM was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by applicable AAA Rules. In such case, USER agrees to reimburse SITE for all monies previously disbursed by SITE that are otherwise USER's obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if USER initiates an arbitration for a CLAIM for more than US$1,000, the payment of fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. The AAA rules will determine whether the arbitration will take place through written submissions by USER and SITE, by telephone, or in person. SITE and USER shall both participate in the selection of an arbitrator. Any award issued through arbitration is enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                            <br>
                            BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, USER IS GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ANY AND ALL CLAIMS IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. INSTEAD, A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR WILL RESOLVE ALL CLAIMS. IF USER DOES NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, USER MUST NOTIFY SITE IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT USER PLACES AN ORDER ON SITE. USER's WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO SITE MUST INCLUDE USER's NAME, ADDRESS AND ORDER NUMBER AS WELL AS A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT USER DOES NOT WISH TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WITH SITE THROUGH ARBITRATION. WRITTEN NOTIFICATION SHOULD BE MAILED TO SITE.
                            <br>
                            Any arbitration or trial of any CLAIM will take place on an individual basis without resort to any form of class or representative action ('CLASS ACTION WAIVER'). Regardless of anything else in this Arbitration Provision, the validity and effect of this CLASS ACTION WAIVER may be determined only by a court and not by an arbitrator. USER and SITE acknowledge that the CLASS ACTION WAIVER is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is non-severable from the agreement to arbitrate CLAIMS. If the CLASS ACTION WAIVER is limited, voided or found unenforceable, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the CLASS ACTION WAIVER. USER AND SITE ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL A CLASS ACTION BE ARBITRATED.
                            <br>
                            All CLAIMS brought by USER against SITE must be resolved in accordance with this Arbitration and Dispute Resolution Section. All CLAIMS filed or brought contrary to this Arbitration and Dispute Resolution Section shall be considered improperly filed. Should USER improperly file a CLAIM, SITE may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to USD $10,000 from USER, provided that SITE has notified USER in writing of the improperly filed CLAIM, and USER fails to promptly withdraw the CLAIM after USER receives notice of improper filing from MBAR .

                            PROVIDER, along with FULFILLER, will use USER's personal information for transactional purposes, including those related to customer service for the transaction. PROVIDER may also use USER's personal information to provide marketing services on behalf of SITE as well as share USER's personal information with affiliated entities of PROVIDER to provide joint content and services and to market the products and services of such entities. PROVIDER may sell USER'S personal information to non-financial organizations, such as companies engaged in direct marketing and the selling of consumer products and services.
                            <br>
                            PROVIDER will use USER information to respond to USER regarding the reason USER contacted SITE. PROVIDER will not share USER information with any third party outside of PROVIDER's organizations, other than as necessary to fulfill USER request, e.g. to fulfill or ship an order, or, in some instances, to partner with another company to provide certain content, programs and services such as those disclosed in the previous paragraph. In those cases, PROVIDER will require third party agents to maintain the confidentiality of the data through a written agreement. In those situations, when USER provides PERSONAL INFORMATION, it may be sent directly to the partner company or PROVIDER may share the information with the partner company. Unless USER requests otherwise, PROVIDER may contact USER in the future to tell USER about specials, new products or services, or changes to this Privacy Policy. Neither SITE nor PROVIDER are responsible for the policies or offerings of any third party, and USER is urged to review third party's policies and terms and conditions, as they may vary.

In such events, SITE and PROVIDER will disclose information relevant to the investigation such as name, city, state, zip code, telephone number, email address, fraud complaints, IP address, and credit card information. SITE and PROVIDER may also share such information with third parties for the purposes of investigating or preventing fraudulent activities. SITE and PROVIDER reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that they believe, in good faith, to be unlawful. In the case of identity theft, USER may authorize a law enforcement officer to request the records from SITE and PROVIDER or USER may request that SITE and PROVIDER send any records directly to a law enforcement officer.

                            <br>
                            Please note that third party vendors, including but not limited to Google, show advertisements for SITE on the Internet. Third party vendors, including but not limited to Google, use cookies to serve advertisements based on USER's prior visits to SITE. To opt out of Google's use of cookies and web beacons, USER can visit the Google advertising opt-out page available on Google's website at https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads. SITE may share, sell, or rent USER information collected voluntarily from USER on the SITE with third party vendors, advertising companies, or analytics providers including but not limited to Google.

                            <strong>IN ADDITION, SITE PARTICIPATES IN TARGETED ADVERTISING.</strong>
                            <br>
                            SITE allows third-party companies to collect certain information when USER visits SITE to provide measurement services to SITE and target ads to USER. SITE uses this information to serve ads for SITE'S products or services or for the products or services of other companies when USER visits this SITE or other websites. These companies use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware or software information, cookie and session ID) and personally identifiable information (e.g. IP address) during USER's visits to this SITE and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to USER. These parties typically use a cookie, third party web beacon, or other similar technologies to collect this information.
                            <br>
                            SITE also works with third parties that collect information across various channels. Such third parties use this information to recognize USER across different channels and platforms, including but not limited to, computers, mobile devices, smart TVs, over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. USER's data may be transferred outside the country from which it was originally collected.
                            <br>
                            Some browsers have a 'do not track' feature that lets USER tell websites that USER does not want to have USER's online activities tracked. Currently, SITE does not respond to browser 'do not track' signals, but SITE does provide USER the option to opt out of targeted advertising. To learn more about this type of advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising, visit <a href="contact.php" class="bb-link">CONTACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT</a>
                            <br>
                            Security takes reasonable precautions to protect USER information. When USER submits sensitive information via SITE, USER information is protected both online and offline.
                            <br>
                            Whenever PERSONAL INFORMATION or other sensitive information (such as credit card data) is collected, we strive to protect that information by encrypting and transmitting that data to SITE in a secure way. PROVIDER is committed to not re-identifying sensitive information collected by SITE.
                            <br>
                            While encryption is used to protect sensitive information transmitted online, PROVIDER also protects USER information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to PERSONAL INFORMATION. The computers and servers on which PERSONAL INFORMATION is stored are kept in a secure environment.
                            <br>
                            Nonetheless, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and therefore PROVIDER cannot guarantee the security of data sent to SITE electronically, and transmission of such data is therefore entirely at USER own risk.
                            <br>
                            If USER feels that PROVIDER is not abiding by this PRIVACY POLICY, USER should contact SITE immediately via <a href="contact.php" class="bb-link">CONTACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT</a>

                            Users Only of Legal Age of Majority SITE is designed and intended for those who have reached the age of majority (18 years of age). By using SITE, USER affirm that USER are at least 18 years of age or older. SITE and PROVIDER are not liable for any damages that may result from a user's misrepresentation of age.

                            You have the right to request that SITE delete any of USER PERSONAL INFORMATION that has been collected from USER and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once PROVIDER receives and confirms USER verifiable consumer request, SITE and PROVIDER will delete (and will direct FULFILLER to delete) USER PERSONAL INFORMATION from records, unless an exception applies.
                            <br>
                            PROVIDER may deny USER deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for PROVIDER or FULFILLER to:

                            To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us:
                            <br>
                            Only you, or USER duly authorized representative, may make a verifiable consumer request related to USER PERSONAL INFORMATION.
                            <br>
                            You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
                            <br>
                            Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify USER are the person about whom PERSONAL INFORMATION was collected or an authorized representative.
                            <br>
                            Describe USER request with sufficient detail that allows PROVIDER to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
                            <br>
                            PROVIDER cannot respond to USER request or provide USER with PERSONAL INFORMATION if PROVIDER cannot verify USER identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the PERSONAL INFORMATION relates to you. In USER request, USER need to provide enough information that allows PROVIDER to reasonably verify that USER are the person that information was collected about.
                            <br>
                            Making a verifiable consumer request does not require USER create an account with us.
                            <br>
                            PROVIDER will only use PERSONAL INFORMATION provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>RESPONSE TIMING AND FORMAT.</strong>
                            <br>
                            PROVIDER will provide a response to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If PROVIDER requires more time (up to 45 days), the PROVIDER will inform USER of the reason and extension period in writing.
                            <br>
                            Any disclosures PROVIDER provides will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt.
                            The response PROVIDER provides will also explain the reasons PROVIDER or FULFILLER cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, PROVIDER will select a format to provide USER personal information that is readily useable and should allow USER to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
                            <br>
                            PROVIDER does not charge a fee to process or respond to USER verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If PROVIDER determines that the request warrants a fee, PROVIDER will tell USER why PROVIDER made that decision and provide USER with a cost estimate before completing USER request.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>NON-DISCRIMINATION:</strong>
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            Deny USER goods or services.

                            <br>

These include but are not limited to a confirmation email with details of USER'S order, a pre-event email reminder about the event to be attended, and a post-event email gathering feedback on the USER'S experience.

                            <strong>COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS) RELATED EVENT CANCELLATIONS AND POSTPONEMENT.</strong>
                            <br>
                            To assure fans' safety during these uncertain times, all tickets are subject to restrictions and requirements put in place by venues, teams, or government authorities as it pertains to proof of COVID-19 vaccination, proof of negative COVID-19 test, social distancing, wearing personal protective gear, age restrictions, or similar measures. If USER cannot attend the event due to USER failure or inability to comply with such requirements, USER will not receive a refund. If the event is held without fans or reasonably similar seats are not available, USER will receive a refund as if the event was canceled.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>IN LIGHT OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO COVID-19 AND WITH GREAT CONCERN FOR OUR CUSTOMERS' SAFETY AND WELLBEING, WE ESTABLISHED THE FOLLOWING TERMS FOR COVID-19 RELATED EVENT CANCELLATIONS AND POSTPONEMENTS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY:</strong>
                            <br>
                            IF AN EVENT IS CANCELLED AS A RESULT OF COVID-19, USER may have an option to receive a credit voucher ('Credit Voucher') in the amount of 100% of the original purchase price (minus any delivery charges) (the 'Value') to be used towards any ticket purchase made on SITE within 365 days from USER Credit Voucher issuance date. Alternatively, USER may request a full refund (minus any delivery charges).
                            <br>
                            Credit Vouchers can be used for separate purchases as long as any portion of the Credit Voucher retains its Value; however, this will not extend USER Credit Voucher's valid through date.
                            <br>
                            USER Credit Voucher has no cash value and cannot be sold, exchanged or combined with any other offer. We may modify or discontinue the new Credit Voucher issuance without notice. Credit Vouchers are void where prohibited.
                            <br>
                            USER Credit Voucher cannot be transferred to another individual or used as a payment method on any other site, other than the site where USER original purchase was made, and it cannot be transferred to a different currency. If the Site where USER original purchase was made is no longer in service, USER Credit Voucher will still be honored.
                            <br>
                            If USER choose not to utilize the Credit Voucher program, please be advised that due to recent events, USER refund may take up to 30 days to be processed.
                            <br>
                            By accepting the offer of a Credit Voucher or Refund, USER agree that no further payment shall be made to USER with respect to the purchase in question and USER agree not to seek any additional refunds, credits or charge backs. You understand that USER Credit Voucher or Refund is the sole remedy available to USER for USER original purchase. If a charge back is filed against the merchant of record with USER credit card company, we reserve the right to withdraw any offers made, including this Credit Voucher offer.
                            <br>
                            If USER take no action after receiving a notification from us, USER will receive a voucher by default. If USER have received a voucher, but prefer to receive a cash refund, then USER must contact our customer service within seven (7) calendar days from receiving the cancellation notification.
                            <br>
                            IF AN EVENT IS POSTPONED OR RESCHEDULED AS A RESULT OF COVID-19, and the original tickets are valid for entry at the time of the rescheduled event, USER original tickets will remain valid for the rescheduled event and USER order will not qualify for a refund or a Credit Voucher. If USER do not feel it is safe for USER to attend the event, USER can always resell USER valid ticket.
                            <br>
                            NO SPECTATORS EVENTS. If USER event is announced to be played without spectators as a result of COVID-19, it will be treated as if the event is cancelled. These tickets will be eligible for a refund or Credit Voucher program unless event organizers inform us otherwise.
                            <br>
                            All other Terms and Conditions remain in full force and effect without amendment or modification.
