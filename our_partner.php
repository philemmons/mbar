                                The delegates of this, the 19th General Service Conference of Alcoholics Anonymous, meeting in official session in New York City, this 25th day of April, 1969, do hereby declare:
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="text-uppercase">Whereas</span>, it is the desire of this Conference to confirm the relationship between Alcoholics Anonymous and the Al-Anon Family Groups, and

                            <p>According to Lois W. â€” "After a while I began to wonder why I was not as happy as I ought to be, since the one thing I had been yearning for all my married life [Bill's sobriety] had come to pass. Then one Sunday, Bill asked me if I was ready to go to the meeting with him. To my own astonishment as well as his, I burst forth with, 'Damn your old meetings!' and threw a shoe as hard as I could."
                                <br><br>
                                "This surprising display of temper over nothing pulled me up short and made me start to analyze my own attitudes."
                                <br><br>
                                "My life's purpose of sobering up Bill, which had made me feel desperately needed, had vanished. I decided to strive for my own spiritual growth. I used the same principles as he did to learn how to change my attitudes."
                                <br><br>
                                "We began to learn... that the partner of the alcoholic also needed to live by a spiritual program."

                        <hr>
                        <p>Al-Anon Family Groups are a fellowship of relatives and friends of alcoholics who share their experience, strength, and hope in order to solve their common problems. We believe alcoholism is a family illness and that changed attitudes can aid recovery.
                            <br><br>
                            Al-Anon is not allied with any sect, denomination, political entity, organization, or institution; does not engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any cause. There are no dues for membership. Al-Anon is self-supporting through its own voluntary contributions.
                            <br><br>
                            Al-Anon has but one purpose: to help families of alcoholics. We do this by practicing the Twelve Steps, by welcoming and giving comfort to families of alcoholics, and by giving understanding and encouragement to the alcoholic.
