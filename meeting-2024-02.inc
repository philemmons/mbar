                We have T-Shirts to decide upon in this meeting. Phillip has created a Zoom poll that we will use to aid us in this important decision.
                <br><br>We also have a consideration for coffee to be available at the conference and we have provided a rough estimate of cost should this be something we may decide as a committee to offer.
                <br><br>
                Our conference is a little less than seven months away so the focus and attention to these items within this meeting is very much appreciated.
